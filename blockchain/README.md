# Blockchain Project README

## Overview
This README outlines the tasks and components necessary for developing the blockchain project, including a CLI and integration with RPC endpoints.

## TODO List

### General Setup
- [ ] Set up the basic project structure.
- [ ] Choose and set up a version control system (e.g., Git).

### Blockchain Core
- [ ] Implement the basic blockchain structure.
- [ ] Develop the block and transaction models.
- [ ] Create core blockchain functionalities (adding blocks, validating the chain).

### Transaction Handling
- [ ] Implement transaction creation and signing logic.
- [ ] Develop transaction validation (including checking for double spending).
- [ ] Handle transaction broadcasting to the network.

### `sender.go`
- [ ] Develop `recipient.go` with recipient-specific functionalities.
- [ ] Implement key management functions (generation, storage, retrieval).
- [ ] Develop functions to create and sign transactions.
- [ ] Add functionality for balance management and transaction history.

### Command Line Interface (CLI)
- [ ] Design and implement the CLI for user interaction.
- [ ] Integrate CLI with blockchain functionalities.
- [ ] Ensure robust error handling and user feedback in the CLI.

### Protobuf and RPC Integration
- [ ] Define protobuf schemas for blocks, transactions, and related entities.
- [ ] Incorporate RPC services in protobuf for network interactions.
- [ ] Implement server-side logic for RPC services.
- [ ] Develop client-side logic for CLI to interact with RPC services.

### Testing and Security
- [ ] Write comprehensive tests for all components.
- [ ] Conduct security audits, especially for key management and transaction signing.
- [ ] Ensure rigorous testing of RPC endpoints.

### Documentation
- [ ] Document the setup and usage instructions.
- [ ] Create technical documentation for the codebase.
- [ ] Update this README as the project progresses.

## Additional Notes
- Keep security as a priority throughout the development process.
- Regularly update and maintain the documentation.
